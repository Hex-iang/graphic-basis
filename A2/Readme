## Game Control Specification 

* Special Keys:

Key_Up              =>  rotate tile orientation
Key_Down            =>  move tile down 1 step
Key_Left            =>  move tile left 1 step
Key_Right           =>  move tile right 1 step
ESC                 =>  quit the game
CTRL + Key_Left     =>  Rotate camera in counter clockwise direction
CTRL + Key_Right    =>  Rotate camera in clockwise direction

* NORMAL Keys:

'p'         => pause the game
'r'         => restart the game
'q'         => quit the game

'w'         => rotate upper arm a bit in counter-clockwise direction
's'         => rotate upper arm a bit in clockwise direction

'a'         => rotate lower arm a bit in counter-clockwise direction
'd'         => rotate lower arm a bit in clockwise direction

'z'         => increase the camera's field of view
'x'         => decrease the camera's field of view 

SPACE       => to release the current tile in the robot arm
ENTER       => to shift the fruit tile colors
