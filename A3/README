* all output images are in the "images" directory 

## Program Usage

raycast [scene option] [max step] [additional option]
  * scene option(-b | -d | -u):
    * -b : bonus scene with loading and rendering chess
    * -d : default scene with rendering sphere
    * -u : user scene with transparency settin on sphere
  * max step(a number):
    * use a number to define the maximum recursive depth of ray tracing program
  * additional option:
    * +s : add shadow effect
    * +l : add reflection effect
    * +r : add refraction effect
    * +c : add chessboard object to the scene
    * +f : add diffuse reflection effect
    * +p : add anti-aliasing effect(default)

    * +p +ps: turn on poisson anti-aliasing effect
    
    * +b0/+b1/+b2/+b3: adjust bonus scene objects(default: +b0), only work with bonus scene
    * +a0/+a1/+a2:  use different accerlerate structure in bonus scene triangle mesh. only work with bonus scene

## Basic Part
  1. Ray‚Äêsphere intersection and local reflectance:       [Achieved]
    * test command: ./raycast [-d | -u] 5

  2. Shadows:                                             [Achieved]
    * test command: ./raycast [-d | -u] 5 +s

  3. Reflections:                                         [Achieved]
    * test command: ./raycast [-d | -u] 5 +s +l

  4. Chess Board:                                         [Achieved]
    * test command: ./raycast [-d | -u] 5 +s +l +c

  5. Refraction:                                          [Achieved]
    * test command: ./raycast -u 5 +s +l +c +r

    * Note: since that in the default scene, there is no transparency setted, please do test this feature through user scene.
      * In the user scene, the transmission rate is set as 1.1 for each ball
    
  6. Diffuse Reflection:                                  [Achieved]
    * test command: ./raycast [-d | -u] +s +l +r +c +f
  7. Super Sampling:                                      [Achieved]
    * test command: ./raycast [-d | -u] +s +l +r +c +f +p

  8. Additional Features: Poisson Anti-aliasing 
    * an alternative way for super sampling
    * test command: ./raycast [-d | -u] +s +l +r +c +f +p +b

## Bonus Part
1. Render Scene With Chess Pieces on Chess Board         [Achieved]
  * In my implementation, I made the program being able to render a scene with four piece of chess and a mirror in the back.
  * You could find the result images in images directory:
    * "images/bonus-scene.bmp"            - the entire bonus scene I rendered
    * "images/low-resolution-chess.bmp"   - the scene with low-resolution chess
    * "images/high-resolution-chess.bmp"  - the scene with all chesses
  
  * Test command: 
    * ./raycast -b 5 +s +l +r +c +p +f +b3 +m +a2
      * Note: Here I recommend using +a2 since it will give the best performance. It will take around 1 minute to render the scene, if you cannot wait, just turn off the mirror by using "./raycast -b 5 +s +l +r +c +p +f +b3 +a2" command, the result should be rendered in 20 seconds.

2. Improve the intersection with some methods            [Achieved]
	* Non-accelerated naive intersection: 
    * test command: ./raycast -b 5 +s +l +r +c +p +f +b0 +a0
	* Single bounding volume accerleration: 
    * test command: ./raycast -b 5 +s +l +r +c +p +f +b0 +a1
  * Spatial grid accerleration:
    * test command: ./raycast -b 5 +s +l +r +c +p +f +b0 +a2


### Intersection case study

For the purpose of comparing each method, I did a case study with different objects in the scene, and following is a comparable result to those scene. You can check the effect through intersection test number and rendering time (on csil linux machine)

* Analysis
	* With my simple bounding box algorithm, I could decrease a order of magnitudes from the number of ray-triangle intersection in naive version of algorithm. 
  * With the spatial grid algorithm, it could further decrease two order of magnitude from the number of ray-triangle intersection in naive version of algorithm.

## Notice: 

In this assignment, I made a dual compilable version to linux machine and mac os x. However, as mac os x does not support some stale glut functionality, I basically disabled the openGL display mode in the mac compilation. And instead, I made the mac version to write a image after the rendering process
